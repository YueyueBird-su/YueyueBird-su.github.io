# Competition Experience.
## National Award.
### China College Students Service Outsourcing Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, *Enterprise Proposition, Second Prize*.
The competition topic was “Image Subject Segmentation,” which is similar to semantic segmentation models such as building extraction from remote sensing images. I ranked second in this type of project and after carefully studying pyqt for a summer, I completed model reproduction, training, testing, and pyqt display. Later on, based on my teammate’s deployment of the model, I used C++ code and QT5 for desktop development and implemented a “fusion test” trick to solve the problem of unclear subject edges caused by poor model quality. Finally, I created software that can segment the main body of selected images (folders) and perform real-time segmentation and display after opening the camera.
## Provincial Award National 
### College Students Mathematical Modeling Competition Sichuan Province, *First Prize Twice* 
In these mathematical modeling competitions, I was mainly responsible for using programming ideas to solve the models proposed by my classmates and obtain calculation results. For example, 1. The interaction of multiple forces; 2. The conduction of temperature, which is basically the solution of ordinary differential equations
# Research Experience
## **Undergraduate Thesis:** *Multi-view Image Dense Matching Method Based on Deformable Convolution*
Completed a multi-view image dense matching method based on airborne images, using a deformable feature extraction architecture to solve the problem of feature deformation caused by changes in perspective.
## **SRTP:** *Water Pollution Source Tracing Based on Raman Spectroscopy Characterization and 1D Convolutional Neural Network Classification*
A deep learning project. Classify Raman spectra of factory water discharge using an existing dataset to achieve source tracing. The main work was to write windows using pyqt. Finally, it was an excellent conclusion and applied for a software copyright.
